This is an App called slide guide. Currently there are API codes that are not in the code and saved with me privately. 

If you want to use this program please end me a email at hpoosarla@gmail.com and I will get back to you when possible. 

Currently in this repository the front-end and back-end code is all in the same folder and not connected. I plan to create a user-interface in the future. 

The project is made for the purpose of:
A way for teachers to record their lectures and convert into slides with perfect meeting notes. These slides can be used by teachers later for reference as well as high-school and college students who are absent.
